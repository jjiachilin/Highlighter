all right. so for constraint satisfaction problems, they're defined pretty simply in the following way. we have basically a set of variables. so we'll discuss it first abstractly and then immediately we'll see some examples. so we have a set of variables, let's call them x1 through xn, and each one of these guys can take values, let's call these d1 through the end, so each one of these is a set of values that the variable can take. so the one set of values that x1 can take, and here we're talking about discrete uh variables, 
so these are discrete values, and then on top of that you just have a set of constraints. now these constraints basically can be thought of as allowable combinations of values. so what i want you to do is find an assignment of values to the variables for each variable x1 through xn, assign it a value from the corresponding domain, we call this also a domain for the corresponding variable. so i wanted to find a value for each variable without violating the constraints that i gave you. that's pretty much it and abstractly 
it is a very simple class of problems to state, but as we mentioned has significant applications. a lot of problems can be formulated this way and you have an efficient way for solving this problem.
